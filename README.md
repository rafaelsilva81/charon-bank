# Charon Bank

Charon Bank is a simple bank application that allows you to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, made with the purpose of enhancing my knowledge in the Nodejs backend development.

The general theme of the app is based in one of my favorite games, [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), based on greek mythology where Charon is a shopkeeper (and ferryman of the underworld) selling items for the player in exchange for gold.
